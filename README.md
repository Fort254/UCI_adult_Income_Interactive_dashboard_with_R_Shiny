# UCI_Adult_Income_Interactive_dashboard_with_Shiny

This project is an **interactive web dashboard** built using **R Shiny** to visualize patterns in income distribution using the UCI Adult Income dataset. It was developed as part of a Coursera data science lab on interactive dashboards.

---

## Overview

- **Goal**: Explore how demographic and employment-related factors affect income class (`<=50K` or `>50K`).
- **Framework**: Built with R and Shiny for interactivity
- **Dataset**: [UCI Adult Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)

---

## Variables
- native_country:the persons native country
- age
- hours_per_week
- education
- workclass
- sex(male or female)
- prediction(to facet my graphs)

---
## Insights Explored

- Does education level affect income potential?
- Are there visible gender gaps in high earners?
- What native countries that are given less income despite having a good education?
- What is the impact of age and sex on salary?
- Does the number of working hours contribute to less income?
- Which workclass faces less income?

## Dashboard Features

- Dynamic plots: bar charts, pie charts, and histograms
- Input controls: filters by gender, education, occupation, etc.
- Responsive UI for better user experience
- Real-time updates based on selections

**Languages**: R Studio

**Libraries**:
  - Tidyverse, shiny

## Fairness Considerations

Due to the inclusion of sensitive features such as **sex** and **race**, this dataset is also suitable for analyzing algorithmic bias and fairness.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Deploy the model via a web app or API
- Perform bias mitigation techniques
- Conduct hyperparameter optimization
- Use SHAP for model interpretability
